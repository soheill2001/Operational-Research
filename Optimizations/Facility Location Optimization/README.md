# Facility Location Optimization

## Introduction
The facility location optimization problem is a well-known problem in optimization where the goal is to determine the optimal location for a facility to minimize the total distance between the customers and the facility. This problem has numerous applications, such as determining the optimal location for a distribution center, warehouse or manufacturing plant.

In this document, we will discuss a Python implementation of the facility location optimization problem using Pyomo. Pyomo is an open-source optimization modeling language that provides a Python interface to a variety of optimization solvers.

## Problem Statement
Given a number of customers located in a 2D plane, the goal is to find the optimal location for a facility that minimizes the total distance between the customers and the facility.

## Conclusion
The facility location optimization problem is a widely studied problem in optimization with numerous applications. This document presented a Python implementation of the facility location optimization problem using Pyomo. The implementation demonstrates how to define decision variables, constraints, and an objective function in Pyomo to model the problem, as well as how to solve the problem using a solver.
