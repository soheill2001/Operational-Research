# String Manipulation Algorithms

This repository contains Python code for two string manipulation algorithms: Levenshtein distance and longest common subsequence. These algorithms are implemented using recursive functions.

## Levenshtein Distance
The Levenshtein distance is a measure of the difference between two strings. It represents the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to change one string into the other.

The `change_string()` function in `Levenshtein_Distance.ipynb` computes the Levenshtein distance between two strings using a recursive approach. It takes two string arguments and their lengths as input, and returns an integer representing the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to change the first input string into the second input string.

## Longest Common Subsequence
The longest common subsequence (LCS) is the longest sequence of characters that appear in the same order in both input strings. It is used in a variety of applications, including file comparison, DNA sequencing, and natural language processing.

The `zirseri()` function in `Longest_Common_Subsequence.ipynb` computes the length of the longest common subsequence between two strings using a recursive approach. It takes two string arguments and their lengths as input, and returns an integer representing the length of the longest common subsequence between the two input strings.
