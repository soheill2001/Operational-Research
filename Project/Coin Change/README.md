# Coin Change

The Coin Change problem is a classic dynamic programming problem that involves finding the minimum number of coins required to make a given amount of change, given a set of denominations of coins. This code is similar to Coin Change problem.

## Introduction
This code is a Python implementation of a recursive algorithm for finding the number of paths in a 4-dimensional space that sum up to a certain value. The algorithm is based on a problem that requires finding all paths of length four in a 4-dimensional space, where each dimension has a certain number of points, such that the sum of the values at each point is equal to a given target value.

## Function Details
The function `find_path_recursive` takes in the following parameters:

+ `x1`: A list of integers representing the first array.
+ `x2`: A list of integers representing the second array.
+ `x3`: A list of integers representing the third array.
+ `x4`: A list of integers representing the fourth array.
+ `i`: An integer representing the current index of x1.
+ `j`: An integer representing the current index of x2.
+ `z`: An integer representing the current index of x3.
+ `m`: An integer representing the current index of x4.
+ `count`: An integer representing the running count of paths that sum to 10.

## Conclusion
The function returns an integer representing the total count of paths that sum to 10.
